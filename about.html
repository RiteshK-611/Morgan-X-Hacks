	<h1>Who We Are</h1>
		<p class="background">Morgan X is an organization centered around bringing together software and future software developers in low income and resource areas. Basically, we just like working on software projects for fun and its hard to find other people doing the samething where we live. We work on having hackathons, dev meetups, and outreach in our communities. We are based in Baltimore, Maryland at Morgan State University.</p>
